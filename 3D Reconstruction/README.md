In this assignment there are two programming parts: sparse reconstruction and dense reconstruction. Sparse reconstructions generally contain a number of points, but still manage to describe the objects in question. Dense reconstructions are detailed and fine grained. In fields like 3D modelling and graphics, extremely accurate dense reconstructions are invalu- able when generating 3D models of real world objects and scenes.


In Part 1, we want to generate a sparse point cloud for the test images: a temple.
In Part2, we will utilize the extrinsic parameters computed by Part 1 to further achieve dense 3D reconstruction of this temple.
