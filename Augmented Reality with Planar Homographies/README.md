This assignment implemented an AR application step by step using planar homography. In the programming section, we will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use them to estimate their homography. 

What our AR Application is going to do is HarryPoterize the video ar_source.mov onto the video book.mov. More specifically, youâ€™re going to track the computer vision textbook in each frame of book.mov and overlay each frame of ar_source.mov onto the book in book.mov. 



The final result of our Augmented Reality application:
