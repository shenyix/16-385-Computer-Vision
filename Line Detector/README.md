This assignment Implemented some basic image processing algorithms and put them together to build a Hough Transform-based line detector.  The detector will be able to fit lines to edges in images.


To run my code:


To check my result on several test images:


The detector may not work well on new image input, and you may need to adjust some hyperparameters to improve performance.
